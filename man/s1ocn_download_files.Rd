\usage{

}
\arguments{
\item{files}{A data frame containing at least the columns \code{Id} and
\code{Name} that identify the products to download. Typically obtained
from \code{\link[=s1ocn_list_files]{s1ocn_list_files()}}.}

\item{dest}{A directory path where the downloaded ZIP archives will be
saved.}

\item{username}{CDSE user name.}

\item{passwd}{Password corresponding to \code{username}.}

\item{workers}{Number of parallel workers to use when downloading
files. Defaults to \code{1} (sequential download).}
}
\value{
A data frame equal to the input \code{files} with an extra column
\code{downloaded_file_path} indicating the path to each downloaded file.
}
\description{
Authenticate against the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE) and
download Sentinel-1 product files provided in a table of product
metadata. Each product is retrieved via the OData API and stored as a
ZIP archive in the destination directory.
}
\details{
The function requests an OAuth access token using the supplied CDSE
credentials. Each product is then downloaded using its product \code{Id}
from the CDSE catalogue. Files are saved to \code{dest} using the product
name with a \code{.zip} extension. The input \code{files} data frame is returned
with an additional column \code{downloaded_file_path} pointing to the
stored files.
